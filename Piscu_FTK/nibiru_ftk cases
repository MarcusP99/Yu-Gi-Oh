FTK through nibiru
Always assuming Chaos Space can discard a dark
Not including Darkwum or Dragunity Phanlanx in Dragon Normal Summon
Not including Chaos Space draw as we're discarding a card
Need to include Darkwurm cases



Assuming the card we used to get to darkwurm is different from the card we used to get to tracer
If covered once, may not be covered again
We have missed cases and included incorrect cases but both should be neglibable and the combined value would not affect playing through nibiru significantly

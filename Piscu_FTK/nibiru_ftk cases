FTK through nibiru
Always assuming Chaos Space can discard a dark
Not including Darkwum or Dragunity Phanlanx in Dragon Normal Summon
Not including Chaos Space draw as we're discarding a card
If Noctovision in hand, draw 1


Assuming the card we used to get to darkwurm is different from the card we used to get to tracer
If covered once, may not be covered again
We have missed cases and may have included incorrect cases but both should be negligible percentage of hands and the
combined value would not decrease the playing through nibiru percentage significantly, the percentage maybe higher.

#FTK + WL is incorrect in the cases where we do not have a way to get to Tracer or RedMD or any other extender. This should not affect the nibiru percentage too much, so didnt feel it was worth changing
Every FTK + [World Legacy Guardragon, One for one] (Need something else if you don't have access to Tracer or REDMD)

Black Metal + [Absorouter] + [a way to tracer, lance]
Black Metal + Baby Chaos + [A way to tracer, lance, monster reborn]
Black Metal + ["Quick Launch", "Monster Reborn", "White Rose Dragon"] + [A way to tracer, lance]
Black Metal + Seyfert + [Reborn, Lv4 Dragon, divine lance, chaos babys, quick launch]

Seyfert + WL (With something else)
Seyfert + [Absorouter] + [a way to tracer, lance]
Seyfert + Baby Chaos + [A way to tracer, lance, monster reborn]
Seyfert + ["Quick Launch", "Monster Reborn", "White Rose Dragon"] + [A way to tracer, lance]
Seyfert + Lv4 in hand + [A way to tracer, lance, monster reborn]

# These do not beat nibiru, just defining set "Normal_extender" (and not including boot sector as extender as we hold till after nibiru if we can)
Dragon Normal Summon + ["Noctovision Dragon", "Monster Reborn", "Quick Launch", "Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon"]
Dragon Normal Summon(not omni or darkwurm) + ["White Rose Dragon"]
Dragon Normal Summon + [a way to send darkwurm to grave]

Normal_extender + Baby Chaos + [A way to tracer, lance, monster reborn]
Normal_extender + ["Quick Launch", "Monster Reborn", "White Rose Dragon"] + [A way to tracer, lance]


#Extender and Extender - [a way to darkwurm or quicklaunch] + ["Noctovision Dragon", "Quick Launch"] = extender_twice
extender_twice + [Absorouter] + [a way to tracer, lance]
extender_twice + Baby Chaos + [A way to tracer, lance, monster reborn]
extender_twice + ["Quick Launch", "Monster Reborn", "White Rose Dragon"] + [A way to tracer, lance]

Chaos Zone + WL (With something else)
Chaos Zone + [Absorouter] + [a way to tracer, lance]
Chaos Zone + [A way to tracer, lance] + ["Quick Launch", "Monster Reborn", "White Rose Dragon"]
Chaos Zone + [Veiler, Ash] + [A way to tracer, lance, monster reborn]
